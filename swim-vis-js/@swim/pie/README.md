**@swim/pie** implements a multi-slice, fully animatable, canvas rendered pie
chart widget.  **@swim/pie** views have numerous easy to animate properties.
Check out the [interactive **@swim/pie** demo](https://www.swimos.org/demo/pie)
to see it in action.  **@swim/pie** is part of the
[**@swim/toolkit**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-toolkit-js/@swim/toolkit) framework.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/pie` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/pie/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/pie/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script can
be found in `node_modules/@swim/pie/dist/main/swim-pie.js`.

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-vis.js`—which bundles the **@swim/pie**
library—along with its `swim-core.js`, `swim-mesh.js`, `swim-ui.js`, and
`swim-mvc.js` dependencies, directly from the SwimOS CDN.

<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-mesh.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ui.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-mvc.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-vis.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-mesh.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ui.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-mvc.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-vis.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, the `swim-toolkit.js` script may be loaded, along with its
`swim-system.js` dependency, from the SwimOS CDN.  The `swim-toolkit.js`
script bundles **@swim/pie** together with all other
[**@swim/toolkit**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/@swim/toolkit)
frameworks.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/pie** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.

```typescript
import * as pie from "@swim/pie";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

**@swim/pie** can also be used as a CommonJS module in Node.js applications.

```javascript
var pie = require("@swim/pie");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-pie.js` script adds all
**@swim/pie** library exports to the global `swim` namespace.
The `swim-pie.js` script requires that `swim-core.js`, `swim-mesh.js`,
`swim-ui.js`, and `swim-mvc.js` have already been loaded.

The `swim-toolkit.js` script also adds all **@swim/pie** library
exports to the global `swim` namespace, making it a drop-in replacement for
`swim-ui.js`, `swim-mvc.js`, and `swim-pie.js` when additional
**@swim/toolkit** frameworks are needed.
