The **@swim/toolkit** umbrella framework provides a set of frameworks for
building pervasively real-time user interface applications.
**@swim/toolkit** incorporates the
[**@swim/ui**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-ui-js)
real-time user interface toolkit, the
[**@swim/ux**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-ux-js)
real-time application framework, the
[**@swim/vis**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-vis-js)
real-time visualizations framework, the
[**@swim/maps**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-maps-js)
real-time maps framework, the
[**@swim/mvc**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-mvc-js)

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/toolkit` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/toolkit/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/toolkit/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all **@swim/toolkit** child frameworks, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/toolkit/dist/main/swim-toolkit.js`.

### Browser

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-toolkit.js`, along with its `swim-system.js`
dependency, from the SwimOS CDN.  The `swim-toolkit.js` bundle supersedes
`swim-ui.js`, `swim-ux.js`, `swim-vis.js`, `swim-maps.js`, and
`swim-web.js`—those scripts need not be loaded when using `swim-toolkit.js`.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/toolkit** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All child framework libraries are re-exported
by the umbrella `@swim/toolkit` module.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/toolkit";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

**@swim/toolkit** can also be used with CommonJS-compatible module systems.
All component libraries are re-exported by the umbrella `@swim/toolkit` module.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/toolkit");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-toolkit.js` script adds all child
framework exports to the global `swim` namespace.  The `swim-toolkit.js` script
requires that either `swim-core.js` or `swim-system.js` has already been loaded.
