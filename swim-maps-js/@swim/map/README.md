**@swim/map** provides graphics views for efficiently rendering animated
geospatial map overlays.  Check out the [traffic map](https://www.swimos.org/demo/map/traffic.html)
and [transit map](https://www.swimos.org/demo/map/transit.html) demos to see
massively real-time maps in action.  **@swim/map** is part of the
[**@swim/maps**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-maps-js/@swim/maps) framework.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/map` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/map/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/map/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script can
be found in `node_modules/@swim/map/dist/main/swim-map.js`.

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-maps.js`—which bundles the **@swim/map**
library—along with its `swim-core.js` and `swim-ui.js` dependencies, directly
from the SwimOS CDN.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ui.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-maps.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ui.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-maps.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, the standalone `swim-system.js` script may be loaded
from the SwimOS CDN, which bundles **@swim/map** together with all other
[**@swim/system**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/@swim/system)
libraries.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/map** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.

```typescript
import * as map from "@swim/map";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

**@swim/map** can also be used as a CommonJS module in Node.js applications.

```javascript
var map = require("@swim/map");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-map.js` script adds all
**@swim/map** library exports to the global `swim` namespace.
The `swim-map.js` script requires that `swim-core.js` and `swim-ui.js`
have already been loaded.

The `swim-toolkit.js` script also adds all **@swim/map** library
exports to the global `swim` namespace, making it a drop-in replacement for
`swim-ui.js` and `swim-map.js` when additional **@swim/toolkit** frameworks
are needed.
