The **Swim Toolkit** TypeScript implementation provides a set of frameworks for
building pervasively real-time user interface applications.  **Swim Toolkit**
incorporates the [**Swim UI**](swim-ui-js) real-time user interface toolkit,
the [**Swim UX**](swim-ux-js) real-time application framework, the
[**Swim Visualizations**](swim-vis-js) real-time visualizations framework, the
[**Swim Maps**](swim-maps-js) real-time maps framework, the
[**Swim MVC**](swim-mvc-js) real-time component framework, and the
[**Swim Web**](swim-web-js) real-time web application framework.

## Umbrella Framework

The **Swim Toolkit** umbrella framework builds on the
[**Swim Core**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/@swim/core)
framework, and provides the following top-level libraries:

- [**@swim/toolkit**](@swim/toolkit) –
  umbrella package that depends on, and re-exports, all **Swim Toolkit**
  child frameworks and libraries.

### [**Swim UI** Framework](swim-ui-js)

The **Swim UI** framework implements a user interface toolkit for pervasively

  scale types that map numeric and temporal input domains to interpolated
  output ranges, with support for continuous domain clamping, domain solving,
  range unscaling, and interpolation between scales.
- [**@swim/transition**](swim-ui-js/@swim/transition) –
  transition types that specify duration, ease, interpolator, and lifecycle
  callback parameters for tween animations.
- [**@swim/style**](swim-ui-js/@swim/style) –
  CSS style types and universal style value parser.

  property-managing animator types that efficiently tween values between
  discrete state changes.
- [**@swim/render**](swim-ui-js/@swim/render) –
  renderable graphic types for SVG/Canvas-compatible path drawing contexts,

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/toolkit` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/toolkit/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/toolkit/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all **@swim/toolkit** child frameworks, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/toolkit/dist/main/swim-toolkit.js`.

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-toolkit.js`, along with its `swim-system.js`
dependency, from the SwimOS CDN.  The `swim-toolkit.js` bundle supersedes
`swim-ui.js`, `swim-ux.js`, `swim-vis.js`, `swim-maps.js`, and
`swim-web.js`—those scripts need not be loaded when using `swim-toolkit.js`.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/toolkit** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All child frameworks are re-exported by
the umbrella `@swim/toolkit` module.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/toolkit";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

**@swim/toolkit** can also be used with CommonJS-compatible module systems.
All component libraries are re-exported by the umbrella `@swim/toolkit` module.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/toolkit");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-toolkit.js` script adds all child
framework exports to the global `swim` namespace.  The `swim-toolkit.js` script
requires that either `swim-core.js` or `swim-system.js` has already been loaded.

## Development

### Setup

Install build dependencies:

```sh
swim-toolkit-js $ npm install
```

### Compiling sources

Use the `compile` build script command to compile, bundle, and minify
TypeScript sources into JavaScript universal module definitions, output
to the `dist` subdirectory of each project.  To compile all targets,
of all projects, run:

```sh
swim-toolkit-js $ bin/build.js compile
```

To compile a subset of projects and targets, include a `--projects` (`-p`)
option, with a comma-separated list of `$project:($target)?` specifiers.
For example, to build the `main` target of the `ui` project, and all
targets of the `vis` project, run:

```sh
swim-toolkit-js $ bin/build.js compile -p ui:main,vis
```

### Running tests

Use the `test` build script command to compile and run unit tests.
For example, to compile and test the `ui` project, run:

```sh
swim-toolkit-js $ bin/build.js test -p ui
```

### Continuous development builds

Use the `watch` build script command to automatically rebuild projects when
dependent source files change.  For example, to continuously recompile the
`main` target of the `maps` project when any source file in the project–or in
one of the project's transitive local dependencies–changes, run:

```sh
swim-toolkit-js $ bin/build.js watch -p maps:main
```

Pass the `--devel` (`-d`) option to expedite recompilation by skipping the
minification step.  Add the `--test` (`-t`) option to automatically run unit
tests after each successful compilation.  For example, to continuosly compile
and test the `ui` project, bypassing minification, and skipping generation of
the main script, run:

```sh
swim-toolkit-js $ bin/build.js watch -p ui:test -d -t
```

### Building documentation

```sh
swim-toolkit-js $ bin/build.js doc -p toolkit
```
