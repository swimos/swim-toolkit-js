The **Swim UX** framework implements a user interface framework for advanced
real-time applications.  **Swim UX** provides popovers, drawers, menus,
toolbars, controls, and other interactive application views and controllers.
**Swim UX** is a part of the broader
[**Swim Toolkit**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/@swim/toolkit) framework.

## Framework

The **Swim UX** framework consists of the following component libraries:

- [**@swim/ux**](@swim/ux) –
  umbrella package that depends on, and re-exports, all **Swim UX** libraries.
- [**@swim/button**](@swim/button) –
  button-like user interface controls.
- [**@swim/token**](@swim/token) –
  attribute, action, and user input token views.
- [**@swim/grid**](@swim/grid) –
  tables, trees, lists, and other tabular views.
- [**@swim/surfaces**](@swim/surfaces) –
  popovers, drawers, and other view containers.
- [**@swim/deck**](@swim/deck) –
  card stack navigation views.

**Swim UX** builds on the [**Swim Core**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-core-js)
and [**Swim UI**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-ui-js)
frameworks; it has no additional required dependencies.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/ux` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/ux/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/ux/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all **@swim/ux** component libraries, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/ux/dist/main/swim-ux.js`.

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-ux.js`, along with its `swim-core.js`
and `swim-ui.js` dependencies, from the SwimOS CDN.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ui.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ux.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ui.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-ux.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, the `swim-toolkit.js` script may be loaded, along with its
`swim-system.js` dependency, from the SwimOS CDN.  The `swim-toolkit.js`
script bundles **@swim/ux** together with all other
[**@swim/toolkit**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/@swim/toolkit)
frameworks.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-toolkit.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/ux** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All component libraries are re-exported by
the umbrella `@swim/ux` module.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/ux";
```

### CommonJS

**@swim/ux** can also be used with CommonJS-compatible module systems.
All component libraries are re-exported by the umbrella `@swim/ux` namespace.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/ux");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-ux.js` script adds all component
library exports to the global `swim` namespace.  The `swim-ux.js` script
requires that `swim-core.js` and `swim-ui.js` have already been loaded.

The `swim-toolkit.js` script also adds all **@swim/ux** component library
exports to the global `swim` namespace, making it a drop-in replacement
for `swim-ui.js` and `swim-ux.js` when additional **@swim/toolkit**
frameworks are needed.

## Development

**Note:**
`swim-ux-js` can be built against the currently checked out `swim-core-js`
and `swim-ui-js` sources by compiling it from the parent `swim-toolkit-js` directory.

### Setup

Install build dependencies:

```sh
swim-ux-js $ npm install
```

### Build script

Use the `bin/build.js` script to build the **Swim UX** framework.
The build script supports `compile`, `test`, `doc`, and `watch` commands,
described below. All build script commands take an optional `--projects` (`-p`)
option to restrict the build to a comma-separated list of projects.

Each project supports multiple output targets; typical targets for a project
include `main`, to build the main sources, and `test`, to build the test
sources.  A specific target can be built for a project by appending a colon
(`:`) and the target name to the project name.  For example, to build just the
`main` sources of the `util` project, pass `-p util:main` to the build script.

Most build commands take a `--devel` (`-d`) option to expedite development
builds by skipping the minification step.

Run `bin/build.js help` to see a complete list of build commands.  Run
`bin/build.js <command> --help` to see a list of options supported by a
particular build command.

### Compiling sources

Use the `compile` build script command to compile, bundle, and minify
TypeScript sources into JavaScript universal module definitions, output
to the `dist` subdirectory of each project.  To compile all targets,
of all projects, run:

```sh
swim-ux-js $ bin/build.js compile
```

To compile a subset of projects and targets, include a `--projects` (`-p`)
option, with a comma-separated list of `$project:($target)?` specifiers.
For example, to build the `main` target of the `tree` project, and all
targets of the `ux` project, run:

```sh
swim-ux-js $ bin/build.js compile -p tree:main,ux
```

### Running tests

Use the `test` build script command to compile and run unit tests.
For example, to compile and test the `button` project, run:

```sh
swim-ux-js $ bin/build.js test -p button
```

### Continuous development builds

Use the `watch` build script command to automatically rebuild projects when
dependent source files change.  For example, to continuously recompile the
`main` target of the `tree` project when any source file in the project–or
in one of the project's transitive local dependencies–changes, run:

```sh
swim-ux-js $ bin/build.js watch -p tree:main
```

Pass the `--devel` (`-d`) option to expedite recompilation by skipping the
minification step.  Add the `--test` (`-t`) option to automatically run unit
tests after each successful compilation.  For example, to continuosly compile
and test the `button` project, bypassing minification, and skipping generation
of the main script, run:

```sh
swim-ux-js $ bin/build.js watch -p button:test -d -t
```
